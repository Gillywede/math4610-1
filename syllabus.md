The information in the table above can be used to contact your
instructor. The best way to reach your instructor is to send an
email. If you need to make an appointment to discuss content or
anything else in the course send an email with a couple of times
and days that will fit your schedule. It is best to meet
face-to-face, but Zoom will also work if there is no other
way. Students should expect to make appointments throughout
the semester and will be required as part of the homework
assignments. You will be required to do this as a participation
assignment in the first week.

## Computer Programming Requirements

---

If you have not completed a computer programming class, for
example USU courses CS 1400 Introduction to Computer Science
 CS 1 and/or CS 1410 Introduction to Computer Science - CS 2,
you will NOT be able to complete this course. This course is
not intended to be a platform for learning a computer
programming language. This course is intended to provide
students with an opportunity to apply an already mastered
computer programming skill set to algorithm development and
implementation. Students MUST be able to write computer
programs on the first day of class - **NO EXCEPTIONS!**

---

## Textbook Information

---

There is no required textbook for Math 4610. Instead the
course materials will be posted on Canvas through our USU
license or on Github in a repository dedicated to Math 4610
(more on git and Github later). Readings used in class that
are found on the internet will have links or pdf files posted
to Canvas or Github as needed. The Github site for the course
is:

[Math 4610 Github Link](https://jvkoebbe.github.io/math4610)

A few remarks:

**Note:** Many students already have a Github account and have
worked with git. If you have, you will still need to create a
repository for some of your work required for successful
completion of the course. You will be asked to create a
repository named "[math4610](https://www.github.com/jvkoebbe/math4610/)"
in one of the first assignments. Note that git and Github
are case sensitive animals. So, make the name match exactly
without quotation marks. Try clicking on the name above in
quotes.

* The materials at the link above are governed by a Creative
Commons License. This license allows free use of the materials
for non-commercial purposes. This includes any derivative works
from the materials on the site given above or posted on Canvas.

## Additional Reading Materials

---

There will be a number of topics that could arise during the
semester. At the instructor's discretion the materials needed
for these topics will be provided either in class, through
handouts, or through posts on the instructor's github web page.

***Note:** This syllabus is posted on the instructor's github
site with the link given above. Also, note that the syllabus
will change from year to year based on how the course evolves
and the instructor teaching the course in the current semester.

---

## Additional Computer Skills

---

There are a number of computer skills that students may
or may not have. As mentioned above, students must be able
to write programs in text form, compile the code into an
executable form using a compiler, and then run the executable
to compute solutions to mathematical problems. Here are a
few computer skills that will be presented/used in the class:

* instantiation of command terminals in multiple forms, e.g. Cygwin and GitBash,
* execution of commands in commands terminals,
* writing programs in high level languages, such as, python, java, c, c++, fortran, and a number of additional languages,
* scripting in shells like sh, bash, csh, tcsh, and ksh,
* developing graphical output using packages such as matplotlib.py or matlab,
* implementation of parallel algorithms on high performance computing hardware such as multicore and gpu systems.

These are skill sets that will be presented and reviewed as
a part of the course. Note that the list above is no where
near exhaustive. The course will wander through topics as
needed. For example, Integrated Development Environments,
(IDE(s)) such as IDLE and VSCode by Microsoft. Both of
these are free to install and use.

## Instructor Comments about the Course

---

This course is intended for advanced undergraduate students
and graduate students who have already taken Math 2270 Linear
Algebra and Math 2280 Ordinary Differential Equations or Math
2250 Linear Algebra and Ordinary Differential Equations. The
content will contain methods for the approximate solution of
relatively simple mathematical problems through algorithms
implemented into a high level computer programming language.
The basic mathematics skill set needed for this course provides
a backbone for computational mathematics and more advanced
courses in numerical analysis and computational mathematics.
However, you should not be enrolled in the course if you
have not learned to write computer programs in a high level
programming language (e.g, C, C++, Python, Fortran, or Java).
If you have not taken a course in computer science, you will
need to drop the course and complete a course like CS 1410 at USU.

* The course meets three days per week. We will be covering a lot
  of material in each and every class meeting.
* Due to the nature of the course content, we will be bouncing
  around through a number of topics in the first couple of
  weeks. Several of the topics will be brief tutorials on
  how to use existing software. For example, we will cover git,
  Github, matplotlib.py, Taylor series expansions, and a lot more
  in the first couple weeks of the course. So, it will be
  important to make time for class.
* Although role will not be taken, students are required to
  attend this course in  the sense that lectures will not be
  repeated. Students are expected to attend all classes and
  participate in discussions during class time. Time will
  be taken in each lecture to answer questions about material
  previously presented and any questions about homework.
* It is highly recommended that students take notes during
  class to keep up with the material presented and to keep
  up with the lectures.
* Be on time! Most students in this course will take
  professional jobs that require an employee be on time
  to work, for meetings, or honoring deadlines. This
  course is no different.

If you have any questions about the course material, course policies,
or any other matters, please contact the instructor for the course via
email, before or after class, or during office hours.

## Instructor Policies

---

The  following list of policies will be used for this course.
During the semester, students will be required to use a few
more computational tools to complete work. These include,
but are not limited to the following list:

1. **Command Line Terminals:** Students will be required to use Linux/Unix terminals to complete many tasks. Basic usage will be covered in class. Note that there are many ways to access command terminals on your laptops and desktops.
2. **git:** Students will need to master the use of “ git” as a part of the class. Note that git is automatically installed with products like Cygwin and Git Bash.
3. **Github Account:** Students must be able to create a Github account to interface work in the class with a publicly available repository. This will be covered in class.
4. **Graphical Output:** Students must be able to produce graphs and and other visual aids for home work tasks. This will be covered in class. In class, the Python package matplotlib.py will be used to create graphical output. Students can use this package or other readily available shareware to create plots. This is one place where Matlab can be used in the course. Matlab has a lot of nice graphical tools for visualization.

### Why Not Matlab or Mathematica?

---

Students often ask questions about Matlab and/or Wolfram Alpha
as options for writing programs. There are two important reasons
for not allowing Matlab as a primary programming language for
the content in the course. These are the following:

* First, in many of the intrinsic routines, most of the details are  
  buried in the  code written by people employed at the Math Works,
  the makers of Matlab. This means that students will not see the
  nuts and bolts of how various numerical algorithms work. One of
  the goals of this course is to analyze the structure of algorithms.

* **Cost!!!** While at USU, the cost for licensing Matlab or
  Maple is more than reasonable. However, corporate licensing
  is very expensive. It is highly unlikely that any company
  will want to license another product along with their own
  code. Students need to know how to write and develop their
  own code, including the hidden details in intrinsic routines.
  This course assumes students want to learn these details.

**Note:** that Matlab or Maple are great tools for prototyping
ideas in applied and computational mathematics. Your instructor
works in Matlab occasionally and used to use Mathematica extensively.
However, your instructor never needed to purchase a license for
these products. These tools were purchased within the structure
of a grant proposal or by USU IT.

---

## Grading

---

Your grade in the course will be determined by the following:

* **Homework** will account for a 100% of a student's grade. Homework
  must be turned in on time via Canvas. Under normal conditions
  late homework will not be accepted. If you must be gone, any
  homework must be turned in on or before the due date. The only
  exception to this rule is for a family emergency. Also, homework
  must be legible. Some of your work will be done using "git" and
  made available for grading using Canvas. This will mean that
  most of your homework will be typed. There will be times when
  a scanned, handwritten solution will be appropriate. Make
  sure these solutions are legible and the scan of the work
  is readable.
