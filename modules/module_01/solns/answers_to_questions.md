##### Question 1 Solution:

<hr>

**Question 1** Verify that the computer you are using for the class is able to handle hardware virtualization. Along with the apps/commands needed to determine whether or not hardware virtualization is enabled, include a screenshot that shows the computer is hardware virtualization enabled. Use something like Snip&Sketch or the equivalent Apple screen shot app.

**Solution 1:** The information we need to answer this question can be obtained by following the instructions in the lesson. To determine if virtualization is enabled, I opened the Task Manager using "Ctrl-Alt-Del" on the keyboard. Then, clicking on the Performance Tab and the following will appear.

![Enabled Check](./images/virtualization_enabled_check.png)

This shows that the desktop Ii am using is "virtualization enabled". Note that the image showing the result desired was created using the Windows utility, "Snip&Sketch". This produces a .png or portable network graphics formatted file.
