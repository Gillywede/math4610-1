
1. Do a version of mappings to diagonals in matrices.
2. Need some examples of linear combinations of vectors of various lengths - when these work and don't work. Cover things like matrix-vector products are linear combination.
3. Introduce saxpy and gaxpy type methods for linear algebra.
4. Write code that will omit length checking: part one should be to define both codes, part 2 should have them timed for large vectors.
5. Write code for subtraction of two vectors with a length check for the two input vectors.
6. Do something with transposes and symmetric matrices. Storage and execution of of operations
7. Show how calling a dotprd will slow things down due to referencing of the routine.
